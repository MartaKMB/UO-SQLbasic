# UO-SQLbasic

Repository created on SQL â€“ basic course on Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan (https://uo.amu.edu.pl/kursy).

In this repository:
-	schemas for practice (i.a. training_company_schema)
-	questions and solutions (i.a. question_solutions_notes)
-	basic use of SQL SELECT and example of other DML commands
-	example of DDL

I learn SQL and this repository is about my beginnings. 
I made a lot of comments (in my language, Polish) because it helps me to learn with understanding.
